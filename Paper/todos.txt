- thecommit -> the commit
-  clearly, this paper and the used data set focusses on open source projects, but i would at least recommend the authors to acknowledge this fact as a threat to validity.
- cite and compare to A. E. Hassan and K. Zhang, "Using decision trees to predict the certification result of a build", ASE, 2006.
- (Z) cite and compare to I. Kwan, A. Schroter, and D. Damian, "Does socio-technical congruence have an effect on software build success? a study of coordination in a software project", Transactions on Software Engineering, 2011.
- (Z) cite and compare to T. Wolf, A. Schroter, D. Damian, and T. Nguyen, “Predicting build failures using social network analysis on developer communication",  ICSE, 2009.
- (Z) In Section IV.C, the authors investigated the relationship between followers and build success. Further information about how many developers have 0/1/<1000 followers would be helpful, as well as an explanation why the authors set the threshold to one follower.
- (M) A minor issue is that the related work could be in a separate section in the end of the paper. Just as a convention.
- (M) Finally, the final paragraph of the classification factors (A.) section is too large. The authors could split this in smaller sentences.
- (M) The research question does not clearly state the target variable (i.e. what is to be predicted?) and could be made stronger by using a 'to which extent […]' wording.
- (M) However, it is not fully clear to me which data they investigated to retrieve the developers’ experience.
- (M) Another issue is that the authors should specify where they present the results of their datasets (before the beginning of the Evaluation section).
- (M) Regarding the classification with decision tree, the authors did not explicitly state if they used the downsampled data only for training or also for testing the model. It is not fully clear to me which part of the data set has been downsampled (should be the training data set of each fold of the cross validation).
possible todos
- (M) Furthermore, they mentioned the Kappa statistic. However, they did not explain where the Kappa statistic come from and what it means.
- (M)-One small issue is that they could justify the significance of their results in B. and C. in the evaluation section.
- (M) In Section IV, the authors used J48 decision tree from Weka for their predictions. However, they did not motivate why they use exactly this classifier instead of other classifiers.
- (Z) add the counts for the decision tree results
- (M) To measure the performance of the classification, the authors mentioned the accuracy of the correctly predicted build results in Section IV.A. The authors should definitively mention also other metrics, such as precision, recall or f1 score, to show the performance of the classifier and achieve a fair comparison between the two used methods. 
- (C) Add the acknowledgements

---------

- hard to read due to many typos
- the hypothesis that the build is equal to commit integration success has not been shown




probably not doing
----------
- Furthermore, the hypothesis that social attributes change less likely recently should at least be supported by some kind of evidence (e.g. showing that this holds for this data set).
- Therefore, it would have been interesting to see whether there is a change on the “success rate” when looking at developers between those two groups (in terms of their number of followers).
- It would be somehow nice to get an idea about the importance of single factors (e.g., by applying random forest classification).
- can we provide evidence that social factors are a proxy for experience
