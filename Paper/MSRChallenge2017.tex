% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
As the software development community makes it easier 
to contribute to open source projects, the number of commits and pull requests 	
keep increasing. However, this exciting growth
renders it more difficult to only accept quality contributions.
Recent research has found 
that both technical and social factors predict
the success of project contributions on GitHub.  
We take this question a step further, focusing on predicting continuous
integration build success based on technical and
social factors involved in a commit.
Specifically, we investigated if social factors (such as being a
core member of the development team, having a large number of followers,
or contributing a large number of commits) improve predictions of build
success.  We found that social factors cause a noticeable increase
in predictive power (12\%), core team members are more likely to pass the build
tests (10\%), and users with 1000 or more followers are more likely to
pass the build tests (10\%).

\section{Introduction}
For managers of an open source project, it is important to ensure that the
project consists of high quality contributions.  As social coding sites attract
more users and projects become more popular, they receive ever more
community contributions.  As the number of project contributions increases,
the project must dedicate more time to vetting these contributions. 
%
The open source
community has developed various techniques to vet project contributions, such as
requiring that pull requests be approved by a core team member~\cite{gousios14}. 
This can become a bottleneck, and thus it is beneficial to prioritize certain
contributions, ideally by predicted quality.

Ideally, the decision to include code in
a project is meritocratic, such that only code quality is a factor
in the decision~\cite{Scacchi07}.
However, beyond commit complexity or correctness, past
studies have shown that the social factors describing the committing developer also importantly
predict contribution success~\cite{tsay14icse, tsay14fse}.
Thus, both technical factors, which describe the commit's complexity, and
social factors, which describe the developer's experience, are important when
investigating contribution success (and thus by extension predicted quality).

This previous work has focused on the predicted acceptance of open source \emph{pull
requests}~\cite{tsay14icse, tsay14fse} and \emph{continuous integration} builds
in a single project~\cite{Hassan06,Kwan11,Wolf09}. 
By contrast,  we are interested in analyzing contribution quality 
in \emph{continuous integration} across multiple open source projects.  While 
pull request
quality is ultimately determined through manual inspection, continuous
integration uses test cases to automatically assess commit quality,
and thus may provide different quality predictors. 
We investigate the factors related to continuous integration build success
across open source projects.
In this study, we analyze a large set of technical and social attributes 
and how these can be used to predict a contribution's quality, measured by the
success of build integration jobs.
We performed this analysis on a large corpus of open source projects
which incorporated continuous integration in their development practice. 
When a contribution to these projects passes integration tests, 
it suggests that the project developers
might have confidence in the changes. 
Thus, we use the commit's build integration status as a proxy for its quality.

We analyzed contributions in the 
context of continuous integration using technical factors and one social
factor from the challenge
corpus~\cite{msr17challenge}, and social factors from a developer's
GitHub profile.  We used the technical factors to estimate the commit's
complexity, and the social factors to estimate the developer's experience.
Overall, our study investigates how different technical and social factors predict
contribution quality. This information can help core team members prioritize project
contributions, and increases understanding of quality enforcement
in software development.

We find that social factors are an important predictor of build success,
but do not fully predict whether a contribution will 
pass all build tests;
that core team members are more likely to achieve build success than non-core
members; and that developers with more followers are more likely to submit 
commits that pass the
continuous integration build.


\section{Research Design}

We present the approach we took to design our study by
following the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology~\cite{Basili84}:

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Goal.}
The \emph{goal} of this study is to understand the relationship 
between social factors that describe 
developer's experience (stars, followers, etc.) and technical properties that
describe a commit's complexity
(files added, files modified, etc.)
when predicting whether a developer's commit
will pass the continuous integration build tests for the project.

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Question.}
%Previous studies have identified a relationship between technical and social 
%factors and pull request acceptance. 
We are interested in understanding whether
social factors, used as a proxy for experience, can be used to predict
commit integration success. If so, 
developers and integrators will have another tool to estimate the quality
of a developer's contribution.
%
Our main research question is:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\emph{Do social attributes
improve prediction of a contribution's build success when compared to
predictions based only on technical attributes?}
\end{quotation}

If social attributes improve build success predication, we are
interested in investigating how particular attributes, such as the developer's
follower count, similarly correlate with success.

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Metric.} We measured software contribution quality by the
build status of the
commit. We used a decision tree classifier~\cite{Quinlan86} to predict build 
success. Decision trees 
use binary decisions on the
attributes to predict a final class. They are well
established and interpretable. We used a Weka J48 decision tree for readability.
We first built a
decision tree classifier using only technical factors to 
predict build integration
success.  We then included the social factors, to 
identify the degree to which social factors improve the model's predictive
power.
%We evaluated the models with 10-fold cross-validation. 

\section{Building the Dataset}
\label{approach}

We built a data set consisting of both technical and social factors:

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Technical Factors.} We collected technical factors from the 
Mining Software Repositories (MSR) Challenge data set~\cite{msr17challenge}.
We extracted the following technical attributes to proxy a commit's
complexity: 
\begin{itemize}
%\item tr\_original\_commit
%\item gh\_build\_started\_at 
\item Source churn, changed lines of code.
\item Files added by this commit.
\item Files modified by this commit.
\item Tests added by this commit.
\item Tests deleted by this commit.
\item Total source files in project at the time of the commit.
\item Number of source lines of code in the project at
	the time of the commit.
\item Travis status, or status of the Travis build integration.
\end{itemize}

The first five factors describe the changes in the commit.  The next two
factors cover the size of the project.  These factors proxy both the commit's complexity,
and the complexity of the project incorporating it.

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Social Factors.} We created a web scraper to extract social data
from developers' profiles.
We used the commit hash and the project name in the 
MSR Challenge~\cite{msr17challenge} data set to locate the
commit web page, leveraging \textit{github.com}'s URL standard for projects and
commit hashes.
%  using the syntax
% below. 
% \newline \newline
% \textit{https://github.com/\textbf{NameOfProject}/commit/\textbf{CommitHash}}
% \newline \newline
%
We scraped the commit author's
\textit{username} from each commit page to
collect the following from the user's public profile:
%(\textit{https://github.com/\textbf{UserName}}). 
%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Number of repositories the developer can access (including those
the developer owns, contributes to, or for which they have
organizational membership access).%
\footnote{https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/}
\item  Number of projects the developer has stared. Starring a project
to shows approval of the repository and creates a bookmark for later 
access.\footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/}
\item Number of developers that follow the author. 
\item Number of developers that the author follows.
\item Number of contributions made in the last year.
\end{itemize}

We also added one item from the MSR Challenge data set, indicating
whether the commit's developer is a core member  
of the associated project.
These social factors are all tied to a GitHub user's profile,
and are generally correlated with users' open source engagement.
Thus, we use them as a proxy for
experience.  If we were unable to find information about an author, we
assigned empty values to the commit.

\vspace{1ex}
\noindent\textbf{Compiling the data sets.} We compiled the gathered data into 
two data sets: one with only the technical
factors and the build status, and another with both technical and social
factors and the build status. We performed this split to analyze how well 
technical factors alone,
and then both technical and social
factors together predict build integration status.

The challenge data set~\cite{msr17challenge} consists
of commits that date as far back as 2011. The social data we 
gathered is accurate for January 2017. To mitigate the threat of
using future results to predict previous events,
we only include commits from the years 2014--2016.  Our intuition is
that these social attributes are unlikely to have significant recent changes.

We converted all Travis build statuses to two possible values:
\emph{successful} (passed in the challenge data set) and \emph{unsuccessful}
(errored, failed, canceled
or started in the original data set). We also condensed all passing and
failing builds in a commit to a single pass or fail for each build status.  If
the commit contained both passing and failing build statuses, we treat it as
both a passing and failed build. 

74.43\% of the builds in the reduced data set were successful, and thus a naive
classifier that always guesses ``successful'' would succeed 74.43\% of the time.
To penalize misclassification for
both classes equally, we created a second \emph{balanced} data set by randomly 
sub-sampling the successful builds until the two build status were
equal, through a process known as downsampling. We downsampled the entire
data set and then trained decision tree classifiers on both.  We validated the
classifiers with cross-validation. Since the cross-validation is stratified, the
50-50 proportion is maintained through the training and testing folds for the
downsampled data. We present results for both
data sets in Section~\ref{sec:successClassification},  and only the full data 
set in Sections~\ref{sec:core} and \ref{sec:followerSuccess}.

the Weka J48 decision tree~\cite{Weka,Quinlan1993}
with default settings and 10-fold 
cross-validation.
We present classification
success rate for technical versus social factors
(Section~\ref{sec:successClassification}); 
build success rate of core project members versus non-core 
members (Section~\ref{sec:core}); and the relationship 
between follower count and build success (Section~\ref{sec:followerSuccess}).

\subsection{Classification with and without social factors}
\label{sec:successClassification}

Table~\ref{resultsTable} shows the results of running the two data sets through the
default Weka J48 decision tree algorithm.  Without downsampling, the 
decision tree shows an increase of 4.09\% \textit{correctly classified} instances when adding social data. On the downsampled data, the decision tree created from the technical attributes
had a classification accuracy of 64.10\%, which outperformed the na\"ive
baseline model that 
guesses all builds passed (50.00\%).
After including the social data
in the data set, the classifier correctly predicted 76.09\% of the data set,
about a 12\% improvement over the model that uses only the technical data.  These results show that
while technical data is helpful in predicting build integration success, social
data can be used to measurably improve predictive accuracy. 

The precision, recall, and
F-measure are calculated over the successful and unsuccessful classes and then
averaged (standard in Weka).  All these measures, along with the Kappa
statistic, increase with social features, which provide evidence that social 
factors improve build success predictions. The mean 
absolute error also decreases, further substantiating the result. 

\subsection{Build success by core team member}
\label{sec:core}

The decision tree results suggested that core team membership is
important to classifying build success (in supplemental material), and thus 
we investigated the question
directly. 
We classified the build success rate for
core team members and non-core team members using the data set without 
downsampling.  We found that core team members
triggered 89.39\% (331827/371208) of the builds in the data set; 75.58\%
(250808/331827) of those builds
passed.  Non-core team members triggered 10.61\% (39381/371208) of the builds 
in the data set,
and 64.70\% (25479/39381) of the builds passed.  The difference in success rate
is statistically significant (the p-value from a Fisher exact
test is 0.0000), suggesting that it is extremely unlikely to have occurred by
chance. Thus, in our dataset, core team 
members are more
likely to have a successful build integration than non-core team developers, likely
because core team members are naturally more familiar with the 
codebase. 



\subsection{Follower relationship with build success}
\label{sec:followerSuccess}

We also investigated whether developers with followers were more likely to have a
successful build integration, since followers could be seen as ``vouching'' for
a developer's abilities.  We therefore investigated the relationship between
follower count and build success rate (on the data without 
downsampling).  We first investigated whether developers with one or more followers
were more likely to pass the build than those without any followers at all. We
removed commits without any author profile
information (20374 builds, reducing the total build count to
350834). Only 0.87\% (3059/350834) of the
contributions in the data set were performed by developers with zero 
followers.  %, leaving 99.13\% (347775/350834) of the contributions 
%performed by developers with at least one follower.
Developers with 0 followers had a successful build commit 68.49\% (2095/3059)
of the time.  Developers with one or more followers were successful 74.78\%
(260056/347775) of the time.  The p-value of this difference, calculated with a
Fisher exact test, is 0.000, suggesting the difference in commit success rate between
developers with no followers and those with at least one follower is
very unlikely to have occurred by chance.
%
By contrast, developers with a large number of followers (1000 or more),
performed 6.94\% (24347/350834) of the contributions in the 
data set; their
contributions had a 78.61\% (19138/24347) success rate. The p-value of the
difference between this success rate and that of developers with no
followers is again 0.0000.  % The p-value means that that the difference between
% developers with 1000 followers and developers with no followers is very unlikely
% to occur by chance.

These results suggest that developers
with more followers are more likely to have a successful integration build.
This may be due to the fact that developers with followers are more likely to
have open source development experience, and the developers' experience
influenced their build success.

\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec-threats}

%\paragraph{Internal validity}
In the study, we use Weka, a well known machine-learning toolkit,
to analyze our data.
Like all tools, Weka may contain bugs. 
Nonetheless, it is a community tested open source tool, which mitigates threats to 
internal validity. We also release our scripts, data, and decision tree 
results in the study.\footnote{https://github.com/squaresLab/MSR-challenge-2017}

We mitigate the risk that our results fail to 
%\paragraph{External validity} 
generalize externally by studying a broad and rich 
data set~\cite{msr17challenge} comprising 1,359 popular projects.
Similarly, the social factors we study may not apply to closed-source
applications; however, open-source ecosystems are intellectually
valuable sources of study on their own. 
%
 Other concerns include the possibility that social factors
 have changed significantly in the past three years, that unsuccessful
 builds are due to
 incorrect test cases (rather than low quality contributions), and that
 information is lost in collapsing commits' multiple builds. We believe these
 are similarly mitigated by a large and varied data set, but leave investigation
 of the effects of these decisions to future work. 
 
\section{Related work}

The most similar related work to this paper is a case study investigating how
social and technical factors affect build
success on a project with 40 developers~\cite{Hassan06}.
We focus on a wide range of open source projects and
measure experience through developer profile information.
Other work has investigated the effects of various factors, such as team
organization, on predicting build success in a single
project~\cite{Kwan11,Wolf09}.
Previous investigations have established relationships between both social and 
technical 
attributes and 
different measures of success, such as pull request acceptance~\cite{gousios14, 
gousios15,tsay14icse,tsay14fse} or evaluation latency~\cite{Yu15}.
Tsay et al.~\cite{tsay14icse} 
show the importance of the social connection between the developer initiating a
pull request and the project integrators. We look at a broader aspect of 
social factors, and focus on predicting the Travis CI build success.
Gousios et al.~\cite{gousios14} found that the commit change location is
an important indicator to commit acceptance rate and that including
test cases increases a
commit's acceptance rate~\cite{gousios15}. We found that number of followers and being a core member are important indicators of build success. 
Bettenburgh et 
al.~\cite{bettenburgh10} discuss the impact of social interactions with 
post-release defects, while Vasilescu et al.~\cite{vasilescu14} explore how different 
project characteristics (programming language, project age, etc.) affect commit 
success when integrated into the automatic build process. In our study, we focus on the comparison between similar technical characteristics and social attributes. Yu et al.~\cite{yu16} 
analyze the impact of CI usage in GitHub and its correlation with software 
quality, while we focus on gain in predictability of software quality when using CI.

\section{Conclusion}

We have analyzed how technical and social factors can be used to
predict high quality open source contributions, measured by continuous
integration build success.  We found social factors improve predictions of build 
success; technical factors led to a 14\% increase in predictive power, and 
adding social factors led to another 12\% increase. 

Overall, we conclude that social attributes proxying experience, such as whether
the developer is a core project contributor,
noticeably influence build success prediction, especially on the downsampled
data. 
%These results suggest that social factors
%are significant predictors when
%evaluating the predictive power of build commit success.
%
In particular, core team members are
more likely to have the build integration pass than non-core team members.  This
result provides evidence that non-core team member commits may not be
scrutinized as closely as core team member commits before the integration build 
tests,
although further study is required to draw definitive
conclusions.
%
Likewise, developers with more followers are more
likely to pass the build.
Developers with 1000+ followers were more than 10\% more succesful in their
builds compared to
developers with no followers.  This suggests that open source developers with
high quality commits may be more
likely to have a large number of followers.

Although we find experience is an imperfect indicator, 
experienced developers appear more likely to make high quality commits.
